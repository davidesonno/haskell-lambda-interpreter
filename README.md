# haskell-lambda-interpreter

Havent made a build yet, but it can be executed using the PowerShell script [ghci.ps1](./ghci.ps1) passing as argument the [Main.hs](./Main.hs), or the test files.

I am currently working on the typed lambda callculus, so it is not complete yet, nor it has been tested.
